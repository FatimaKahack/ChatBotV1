# ChatBotV1 - Using regular expressions

**Description:** 
This is the first version of an ongoing project designed to help reduce the growing number of recyclable material going into landfills instead. The idea behind this project is to create a text based chat bot that would communicate with users about the material they want to recycle. Users give the chat bot information about the item to be recycled and in turn the chat bot would relate the recycling procedure. 

**Implementation Method:** 
This chat bot is implements with python regular expressions and dictionaries. Using regular expressions the chat bot would look for key words in user input and reply accordingly. The chat bot follows a state cycle of asking user the material to be recycled, such as plastic, confirming whether it got it correct, and informing the user of the recycling procedure. Dictionaries are use to help chat bot recognize the current state and what to ask/say next to the user. 

**How to run (Steps):**

1. download chatbot.py file 
2. run python3 chatbot on terminal 
3. ask the chatbot what material to be recycled
